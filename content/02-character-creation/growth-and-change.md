Characters begin play with five improvement points (IP).
You may choose to spend them immediately or hang onto them until later.

Characters in Pentola advance in a few ways:

1. By using their skills, characters have a chance to improve those skills.
1. By acting in the world, characters may improve or lose their reputations.
1. By interacting with the people and groups with whom they have relationships, those relationships grow stronger or weaker and new ones may form.
1. By spending improvement points gained by achieving ambitions or by spending long periods of time practicing and researching, characters can improve themselves.

## Gaining IP via Practice or Research

During downtime between adventures the players may improve their characters.
For every three month period of dedicated practice or research a character may gain 1IP.

{{< aside mechanical "Time Scale" >}}
This timeline assumes that your characters take breaks from seasons of adventuring and getting into trouble and that you're tracking downtime by weeks or months.
A simple tweak to this is to just make practice/research a downtime action and everytime the player characters take it during arbitrary downtime, give them 1 IP.

## Improving Skills Through Use

Once per adventure when a character makes a normal or harder test and uses a relevant skill bonus, make a mark beside that skill.
At the end of each adventure, roll a d100 for each skill you marked during play.

+ If the result of the roll is higher than the skill bonus, you have improved it—in this case, increase the bonus by 3.
+ If the result is lower, the character has not learned enough to improve.

**Every time** you botch a test using a skill, add 5 to the skill bonus.
This represent a character gleaning new understanding from failure.

There is no limit to the bonus a skill can reach.

{{< aside example "Improving Skills" >}}
After their first adventure, Taryn has successfully used the following skills: leadership, first-aid, scrounging, and wrestling.
The player rolls 1D100 for each skill:

+ Taryn rolled a 55 against Leadership (50%), and improves it by 3 to 53%.
+ Taryn rolled a 82 against First Aid (20%) and improves it to 23%.
+ Taryn rolled a 42 against Scrounging (45%) and does not improve it.
+ Taryn rolled a 40 against Wrestling (30%) and improves it to 33%.

## Gaining and Losing Reputation

Every time a character takes an action which is witnessed and could reinforce a character's reputation, make a mark to the right of the reputation on your character sheet.
Every time a character takes an action which is witnessed and could degrade a character's reputation, make a mark to the left of the reputation on your character sheet.

After each adventure, note the total marks against each of the character's reputations—one mark which reinforces it cancels out one which degrades it.
Roll a d100 for each remaining mark.
If the mark is to the right of the reputation and the result is higher than the reputation bonus, increase it by 3.
If the mark is to the left of the reputation and the result is lower than the reputation bonus, decrease it by 3.

{{< aside mechanical "Reputations Over Time" >}}
This system is intended to reduce the amount you need to roll during an adventure for your reputations, but you could, optionally, just roll every time a reinforcing or degrading action is taken.
Alternatively, you could just shift the reputation bonus by 3 with each action and skip rolling altogether.

## Changing Relationships

Every time a character fulfills an obligation or grants a favor to an ally, dependent or organization, thwarts an enemy or is thwarted by them, make a mark to the right of the relationship on your character sheet.
Every time a character fails an ally, dependent, or organization, or ignores an enemy threat, make a mark to the left of the relationship on your character sheet.

After each adventure, note the total marks against each of the character's relationships—one mark which reinforces it cancels out one which degrades it.
Roll a d100 for each remaining mark.
If the mark is to the right of the relationship and the result is higher than the relationship bonus, increase it by 3.
If the mark is to the left of the relationship and the result is lower than the relationship bonus, decrease it by 3.

{{< aside mechanical "Relationships Over Time" >}}
As with reputations, you may want to roll as soon as the action happens or just automatically modify the relationship without a roll.

## Spending Improvement points

Characters can spend improvement points to improve skills, vocations, and characteristics, to modify relationships and reputation, to purchase new knacks, dweomers or miracles, or improve existing knacks and miracles.

You can choose to spend one improvement point to modify a skill, reputation, relationship, or memorized dweomer bonus by 5 points.

You can choose to spend two improvement points to modify a vocation bonus by 5 points.

You can choose to spend one improvement point to increase one characteristic by one point.
The maximum a human character can increase a characteristic to is 75.
For non-humans, the maximum for a characteristic is equal to the maximum possible starting score for the characteristic plus 15.

You can choose to spend one improvement point per magnitude to acquire or improve an knack.

You can choose to spend two improvement points per magnitude to acquire or improve a miracle.

{{< aside mechanical "Improvement Points and Rate of Change" >}}
Improvement points are handed out mostly when characters fulfill or invoke their ambitions and relationships.
Players can expect a steady trickle of improvement points if they're working towards their goals or leaning into their relationships, but advancement is still relatively slow and flat.

You can speed up the rate at which characters acquire improvement points by giving out more for fulfilling ambitions or by adding new ways to acquire improvement points.

This is particularly useful for encouraging other modes of play and interaction.
For example, you might give characters improvement points for resolving group or community ambitions in additional to personal ones, or for discovering new lore about the city or magic or a faction, or setting up new relationships between factions.
