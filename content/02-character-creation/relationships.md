title: "Relationships"
weight: 70
---

When you begin play, choose an ally, a dependent, and either an enemy or an organization.
You have a relationship bonus with each of these equal to 25%.

+ **Ally**. This is a group or person a player character can ask for aid, can call in favors from, or with whom they otherwise have a positive relationship.
+ **Dependent**. This is usually the character's family or a group that relies upon them.
+ **Enemy**. This is a sworn enemy.
  Interactions with this person or group are usually negative.
  They may be a recurring foe or antagonistic organization.
+ **Organization**. This could be a wizards' sorority, a former regiment, or even a cult.
  The character has an association with this organization; they typically deal with this group on a favorable basis.
  GMs should determine the maximum scale of an organization, which could be as great as a whole nation, or just a small wandering band of minstrels.

{{< aside mechanical "Relationships and Hooks" >}}
Relationships are intended to provide the referee—and the players—with hooks and handholds by which to attach characters to the city.
An Ally should provide information or jobs, a dependent should get into trouble frequently, an enemy should try to inconvenience or harm the character and thwart their goals, and organizations should actively generate problems and opportunities alike.

Interacting with established relationships is one of the primary means by which characters gain improvement points, so keep that in mind.
Not every interaction with a relationship will generate a chance for IP, but lots of them should.
{{< /aside >}}

Make a relationship test whenever you want to lean on the relationship in the fiction or take advantage of the relationship's mechanical advantages.
As usual, in some situations a roll is not called for, depending on your intent and approach.

On a critical success for a relationship test, the character gains a very positive response, and an increase of 1D6% to their relationship.
On a botch the character damages their relationship with the party and loses 1D4% from their relationship.
Further, after a botch, the player cannot call on a relationship for rest of the adventure.
In the case of enemies this means that they have accidentally aided them in some way.

You can purchase new relationships later with improvement points for the cost listed; new relationships start at a bonus of 10%.
New relationships may arise from play—in these cases, they start at 5%.

| Relationship | IP Cost | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|:------------:|:-------:|:-----------|:--------------|
| Ally         | 2       | Loan an appropriate item or finances; assist on social test; provide info and/or employment | Allies demand favors of the character, in the form of money, errands etc for each favor given; enemies of your ally become your enemies.
| Dependent    | 1       | Characters gain 1-3 additional Improvement Points where they support, aid or defend Dependents. | Dependents regularly get themselves and the character into trouble; Enemies will target dependents to harm the character
| Enemy        | 2       | Gains +25% to tests in the attempt to thwart their enemy;  gain 1-3 additional IP for thwarting an enemy's plans; gain employment by enemy's opponents | Enemies will try to harm characters as often as possible; All interactions (parleys, influence, negotiation) with an enemy will be at one difficulty rating harder than normal.
| Organization | 2       | Can access the facilities offered by the organization; can gain information and possible employment | Organizations typically demand a charge for their services, either in cash or a favor; Enemies of an organization may harry and harm the character for their relationship to the organization.

{{< aside example "Relationships in Play" >}}
At the start of play, Taryn selects Rose Carozza, their aunt and a Warden, as an ally.
Taryn takes Spot, a miniature tiger, as their dependent.
Finally, as Taryn's goal is to become a full fledged member of the Wardens, Taryn takes them as an organizational relationship.

During Taryn's first session it becomes clear that lacking a proper weapon (Taryn only has a single dagger which doubles as their utility knife) is a problem.
Taryn asks their aunt, Rose, for a loaner weapon and makes a relationship test.
Taryn's Iron is 18, to which they add their relationship bonus, 25%, for a total goal of 43%.

Taryn rolls a 32 and the referee declares that Aunt Rose lends an old shortsword and a spare longbow to Taryn—on the condition that Taryn must succeed in the trials to join the Wardens or return the weapons upon failure.

Later in the adventure, Taryn is ambushed in an alley by Spy, who has been paid by the father of a man Rose killed in a judicial duel—Taryn has inherited their aunt's enemies.

{{< aside mechanical "Starting Relationship Details" >}}
It can be a bit daunting to spin out several detailed relationships all at once.
One useful way to handle this is to collaboratively add details to the relationships in play—that is, when you think your ally would first be useful to your character or the game generally, invoke them and flesh them out on the fly with your referee.
The referee, in turn, is encouraged to think of times when your relationships would drive interesting choices for your character, be helpful in moving things forward, or throw problems into the fiction for you and the other players to handle.

In either case, don't feel like you need to have several pages of relationship context built up to use a relationship;
sometimes it's enough to know that your dependent is your nephew and spin things out from there.
Of course, it's okay to take some time to flesh those relationships out, too!
Just make sure that the player and referee are on the same page so things can adjudicate smoothly.

## Organization

To randomly generate an organization, roll 1D4 to determine the type of organization, then roll on the related table to determine details about it.
Use those details as the skeleton of ideas to flesh out a group of people in the world—Pentola is enormous and varied, far too large and fractured to detail every organization you might encounter.

**Guardians of the True Word**

A snarling bronze drake is embossed upon the doors to this old and prestigious research guild.
The academics within practice psychohistorical magics and divination to discern the Truth of the World as it has been—they then share this interpretation with each other orally, crafting poems as records in a tongue taught only to full members of the guild.
They are funded by students of the True Word but do not evangelize to others—they seek only to understand and share with those who share their passion.
Artists of the Word stay with the Guardians for weeks at a time, learning the new discoveries and committing them to memory, that they may go out into the world and create works which echo this truth.

The Truth is never spoken aloud to outsiders, but no word spoken by a believer is ever heard only once—every syllable seems to echo in the air, no matter how hushed the tone.

**The Troutslappers of Her Aquatic Majesty**

The adherents of Nianzhen, the Mermaid Queen, are a terrifying force in the canals and spires of Pentola.
These devout souls carry their holy symbol, a two foot long solid bronze trout, as a weapon and a warning.
They stalk the city in deep red robes and seek out those who would break Nianzhen's commandments—which change daily depending on the inquisitor.

They practice their faith by routinely drowning and reviving each other in an attempt to get closer to Her Aquatic Majesty and understand her mysteries more completely.
Their only unwavering belief is that art, especially statues, are an affront to Her—after all, water is formless.

Even when out of their vestments these pious interlocutors are visible by their massive ears—all the better to hear blasphemy on the lips of citizens...

**Conjuration of the Peaceful Waves**

This group of sailors specialize in the Craft as applied to sailing, and moreover, into melding art with seamanship.
Wherever Conjurers of the Peaceful Waves are found, so too are fantastic ropes, sails, anchors, lanterns, and all sorts of other equipment.
The Conjurers lose their left pinky as they advance in the organization, the digit turning a brilliant blue and slowly disintegrating as they improve their skills.

The Conjuration gathers in beautifully crafted halls across Pentola and even has a few halls in other lands and cities—anywhere the seas need crossing.
They are serious competitors for any and all other groups and guilds who make goods for seafaring.

**Skylion Spire**

Exploding up from an isle in the Pentolan Bay is the Skylion Spire, a sheer megalith of a perfect cylinder.
Far above, beyond the sight of those in the canals there is a feature atop the spire through which the high winds sometimes pour, causing echoing reverberations which sound like ten thousand lions roaring over the city.
The Skylions who live in the spire and recruit for it are amongst the most dangerous militants in the city, mostly made up of warriors who are both champions, able to channel miracles, and battlecrafters able to weave the dweomers into combat and stack the odds in their favor.

Their crest, a bloody Griffin's head, is emblazoned on their banners and tunics.
The skylions are renowned across the city for being deadly duelists and interveners, often useful as proxies for a duel in a court of swords or as mercenaries when up against unbelievable odds.
The skylions seek glory and recognition every day, aiming always to be known as the greatest masters of violence and battle.
