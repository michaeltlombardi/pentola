title: "Vocations"

Characters each have a vocation - a calling or an occupation to which a character is inexorably drawn and which helps to define them.

Whenever your character is faced with a test which can be reasonably argued to be relevant to their vocation you may add your vocation bonus to the test's goal.

Every character begins play with a single vocation at 25% and can optionally acquire a second vocation later by spending five IP.
No character can have more than two vocations at a single time.

If you want to trade one of your vocations for another, you can do so freely, though the bonus resets to 25%.

{{< aside example "Using Vocations" >}}
Tick-Tock Tarasi has _Clockmaker_ as a vocation.

When attempting to shoot a crossbow at an enemy mercenary, she could not fall back on her Clockmaker vocation to improve her chances of success.
She could, however, leverage her vocation to improve her chances to pick a lock, assuming she doesn't have a more relevant skill.

In cases where she _does_ have a relevant skill, she can choose to use whichever bonus is higher.

{{< aside mechanical "Vocations and Intended Function" >}}
Vocations are a sort of fall-back option, they should rarely be the first-choice for a test.
Character specialization is described by their _skills_, vocations act as surety that characters don't fail at things in their primary domain.

You can do entirely away with skills and just rely on vocations, but be aware that this reduces the number of knobs and levers available.

One thing you can do is increase the IP cost of raising a vocation to offset the temptation to use it for everything (if you find that to be a problem).

{{< aside note "Improvement Points (IP)" >}}
Improvement Points, also called IP, are the currency by which your characters advance in Pentola.
You gain IP by fulfilling ambitions, protecting dependents, and thwarting enemies.
These activities are covered more fully in later chapters.

You can write your own vocation, roll to determine your vocation based on the table below, or choose a vocation that you think fits your character.
