Once you have rolled for your starting characteristics you can determine your attributes.
These are pools of points which represent your ability to sustain damage (in the case of Blood) and use magic or special abilities (in the case of Tephra).

+ **Blood:** Add your character's Bone and Iron - the 'tens' digit is their Blood.
  In Pentola, citizens refer to how thick or thin someone's blood is as a metaphor for how tough they are, or how much danger seems to affect them.
  People who are thick-blooded stride through dangers recklessly, coming out relatively unscathed, and survive injuries you would expect to be lethal.
  When someone's luck seems to be running out in a fight, Pentolans will oft remark on their thinning blood.
  Throughout these rules and in supporting documents you may see it written with the following glyph: {{< icon blood >}}
+ **Tephra:** Add your character's Flax and Iron - the 'tens' digit is their Tephra.
  Pentolans describe people as being heavy with Tephra if they are intrinsically powerful or adept at magic, believing them to be literally full of magic.
  If someone is light on Tephra or has been dropping it, Pentolans believe they are not capable of much more magic... at least, not without thinning their blood dangerously.
  Throughout these rules and in supporting documents you may see it written with the following glyph: {{< icon tephra >}}

{{< aside example "Determining Attributes for Taryn" >}}
Having rolled the characteristics for Taryn we can calculate their attributes:

{{< icon blood 1.5em 1.5em >}} With a Bone of <strong>51</strong> and a Iron of <strong>18</strong> (total of <strong>69</strong>), Taryn's Blood is <strong>6</strong>. <br />
{{< icon tephra 1.5em 1.5em >}} With an Flax of <strong>44</strong> and a Iron of <strong>18</strong> (total of <strong>62</strong>), Taryn's Tephra is <strong>6</strong>.
