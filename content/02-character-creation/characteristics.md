Characters in Pentola have three characteristics: Iron, Flax, Bone.

+ **Iron:** In Pentola, iron is both rare and precious as it has apparent metamagical and demon-abjuring properties; any magic effects are more portant when iron is incorporated in the application and demons of all sorts shy away from iron as it ignores their abilities and defenses.
  Iron represent's a character's force of will, presence, and metaphysical aptitude.
  When someone is _heavy_ with iron, they're powerful personally and magically, a noticeable presence in any room.
  If they're _light_ on iron, they may slip by unnoticed or unremarked.
  Throughout these rules and in supporting documents you may see it written with the following glyph: {{< icon iron >}}
+ **Flax:** is a crop which represents so much of human ingenuity—one of the earliest and most widespread crops domesticated, flax supplies the Pentolans with food, oil, cloth, paper, and paint; it represents ingenuity, industry, trade, craft, and knowledge to the Pentolans.
  Flax represents a character's mental prowess and training, including their knowledge and intuition.
  When someone is _stuffed_ with flax, they're knowledgeable and well trained, able to apply their knowledge in all sorts of situations.
  If they're _meager_ with flax, they lack training and education and have to rely on their more limited direct experience and first-hand knowledge to see them through.
  Throughout these rules and in supporting documents you may see it written with the following glyph: {{< icon flax >}}
+ **Bone:** Pentolans are not strangers to danger or hard work and associate bone with both, priding themselves on their physical daring and the use of their bodies to accomplish their tasks, though they are ever mindful of their own ultimate fragility.
  Bone represents a character's physical prowess and training, including their strength, agility, hand-eye coordination, etc.
  When someone's _strong-boned_, they are fast, powerful, flitting from danger to danger with ease and grace.
  When they're _brittle-boned_, they are unable to overcome strenuous physical obstacles, having to rely on their other resources to get things done.
  Throughout these rules and in supporting documents you may see it written with the following glyph: {{< icon bone >}}

Characteristics are the base goal for tests.

Declare _what_ you're trying to accomplish (your intent) **and** _how_ you intend to accomplish it (your approach).
The referee will determine if your action requires a test and which characteristic is most appropriate.

Then you'll try to roll under the appropriate goal.
Your characteristics determine your base chance of success at any given test, but you'll _usually_ be able to add a bonus from a relevant skill, vocation, or ability.

You determine your starting characteristics by rolling three twenty-sided dice (3d20) for each characteristic in order.
You roll first for Bone, then for Flax, and finally for Iron.

{{< aside example "Summing 3d20" >}}
When determining a characteristic you roll 3d20.
Assuming you rolled a **13**, a **7**, and a **16**, the sum of these results would be **36**.
{{< /aside >}}

A **30** in a characteristic is the average for a person—higher scores are above average—and a **75** is the absolute upper bound of anyone not affected by special abilities or conditions.

{{< aside mechanical "On Starting Characteristics" >}}
We use 3d20 to determine characteristics for a couple reasons:

1. Homage—this plays into the history of the hobby, where players roll 3d6 to determine their attributes.
2. A bell curve—this will tend to give results near 30, with few characters who have characteristics either very high or very low.

Note that this applies to _humans_, but that other creatures—demons, monsters, etc—can and _probably should_ have their characteristics determined by a different formula.
For example, a minotaur might roll 7d12 for their body and power but only 3d10 for their intellect.
Similarly, a stormraven might have a body of 1d12+12, an intellect of 2d20, and a power of 5d20.

You could modify this to create more heroic player characters—2d20+20 will tend to create characters with average characteristics around 40.
This isn't the default because Pentola leans into the lethality and danger of combat and magic.

{{< aside example "Determining Characteristics for Taryn Carozza" >}}
To determine Taryn's characteristics, we roll 3d20 each for {{< icon iron >}}, {{< icon flax >}}, and {{< icon bone >}}:

{{< icon iron 1.5em 1.5em >}} <strong>18</strong> -- basic <br />
{{< icon flax 1.5em 1.5em >}} <strong>44</strong> -- comprehensive <br />
{{< icon bone 1.5em 1.5em >}} <strong>51</strong> -- <em>extraordinary!</em>

At the beginning of play Taryn has significantly less personal power than most people, has an average education and knowledge-base, and is stronger, tougher, and more agile than most people.
