Skills are things a character specializes in doing.
In cases where a character has both a vocation _and/or_ one or more skills which could apply to action, use whichever bonus is higher.
After a character successfully passes a normal or hard test against a skill, place a mark to the right of the skill.
During the next down time between adventures, roll a d100 for each skill with such a mark; if the result is greater than your current skill bonus, increase your bonus by 3.
In either case, erase the mark.

{{< aside example "Increasing Skills Through Use" >}}
The rule as written allows characters to increase their skills through use, though slowly.
It's also designed to prvent spamming the same skill over and over as a solution to all problems as you mark it only once per adventure.
As discussed at the end of this chapter in the section on [Improvement Points](./j-improvement-points.md), you can also improve your skills by training and spending IP.
Use isn't the only way to improve your character's skills but it's the only way to do so without spending downtime/IP.

At the beginning of play, a character has 250 percentage points to spend on skills, where each point grants the character a +1% chance of success to related actions.

In Pentola there is no defined skill list, but here are a few examples for inspiration:

> Dodge, Archery, Fencing, Culture (Gascon), Alchemy, Athletics, Driving, Bluffing, Persuasion, Rhetoric, Mechanisms, Streetwise, Trade, Literacy (Pentolan), Occult Lore, Medicine, Wrestling, Painting, Swimming, Thaumaturgy, Drakeback Riding, Herbalism, Mathematics, Goldsmithing, Scultping, Researching, Stealth, Haggling, Literacy (Aydinlar), etc.

{{< aside example "Skill nad Vocation Bonuses in Action" >}}
Tick-Tock Tarasi has _Clockmaker_ as a vocation (25% bonus), as well as the skills Crafting (50%), Literacy [Pentolan] (35%), Researching (30%), Alchemy (40%), Occult Lore (30%), Diabolism (20%), Dodge (20%), and Appraisal (20%).

**Scenario 1:** Shooting a Crossbow

None of Tarasi's skills or her vocation apply to this action, so she can't add any bonuses to it.

**Scenario 2:** Picking a Lock

In this case, Tarasi has no skills that apply to this action, but her vocation does - so she can add that bonus to this test.

**Scenario 3:** Appraising a Lock

In this case, both Tarasi's vocation _and_ her skill Appraisal apply to this action.
Her vocation has a higher bonus (25% vs 20%), so she would use her vocation bonus on this test.

**Scenario 4:** Appraising Art

In this case, only Tarasi's Appraisal skill applies to this action, so she would add that bonus to this test.

{{< aside note "Archetype Skills" >}}
If you're unsure of what sort of character you'd like to play mechanically, you may choose to roll for an archetype on the table below or select one freely.

Instead of having 250 points to spend on skills, you gain the skills listed for your archetype and have 50 points left to distribute.

{{< aside mechanical "Skills and Ambiguity" >}}
Note that some of the skills overlap or seem a bit random - it is intended that you pick skills that you want your character to specialize in, then use those specializations to solve problems.
The list is freeform so you can capture _exactly_ what makes your character yours.

You can determine if a skill is too broad mostly by judgement:
Fighting is probably not specific enough, but a particular fighting style is okay.
Influence is too broad, but bluff, rhetoric, pursuasion, and bluster are all okay.
Largely, if there's a more specific word that can speak to a character's _approach_, rather than their _intent_, it's an indicator that the more specific word should be used.
Sometimes, this isn't possible.

You can also swing the other way and go for more vague skills that apply more broadly, but be aware that characters will likely accrue a short list of skills with high bonuses.

{{< aside mechanical "Passively Using Skills" >}}
Sometimes you'll want to represent that a character is knowledgeable rather than skilled in a particular action.
This does _not_ imply that there are no actions to test for with a given skill!
Knowledge of medicine might help you set a bone or identify an illness or determine someone's overall hardiness.
Similarly, expertise in wrestling will convey knowledge about things outside of being able to grapple - they'll pick up kinesiology, reading people, etc.
Reward characters for specializing!

If a character's skill ranking is comprehensive, consider that they automatically know anything an apprentice in that field might know. For everything else, make them test.
If a character's skill ranking is extraordinary, consider that they automatically know anything a seasoned professional in that field might know. For everything else, make them test.
If a character's skill ranking is incredible or unbelievable, consider that they automatically know anything about their field that isn't hidden, unique, or otherwise very hard to discover. For everything else, make them test.
