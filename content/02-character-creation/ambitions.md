title: "Choosing Ambitions"
weight: 40

All characters start play with one or two long term ambitions.
Achieving ambitions changes your character—in a world where what you do and believe creates a feedback loop with the ambient magic to transform you, ambitions are fuel for that engine.

Long term ambitions are things that are a character's motivation in life, only achievable over multiple adventures.
Short term ambitions are usually relevant to the adventure currently being played and are determined within the first hour of each session.
Short term ambitions are removed from the character sheet at the end of each session.
Ambitions are always removed from the character sheet when completed.

Whenever a short term ambition is achieved, note which characteristic played the most vital role in achieving it and roll a d100, comparing the result to the characteristic's current rating:

- if the result is over the current rating, it improves by two
- if the result is equal to the current rating, it improves by five
- if the result is under the current rating, it improves by one

Long term ambitions unlock related knacks, the focus and dedication required to achieve them ensuring that a character is noticeably different after fulfilling it.

Mark your character's long term ambition on your character sheet.
A character may record up to two long term ambitions and one short term ambition on their character sheet at a time—you may pursue other ambitions, but these are the ones held most deeply in your character's psyche.
