There are a few things to note while reading this book.

### Example Text

Examples describing how something should play out will always be rendered like this:

{{< aside example "An Example of an Example" >}}
Example text will be here.
{{< /aside >}}

### Rules Text Asides

It will sometimes be necessary to make a note to the reader about the rules text to provide context or let them know where else to look in the book.
These notes will always be rendered like this:

{{< aside note "Aside Title" >}}
A summary of the reason for the aside and useful information for the reader.
{{< /aside >}}

### In-World Asides

Occasionally, this book will include _in-world_ asides - by which we mean these are narrative pieces or information given from the perspective of a person in Pentola.
They will always be rendered like this:

{{< aside inworld "On Pentolan Literacy" >}}
It is often said, especially by those bright scholars of the Aydinlar Empire, that Pentolans have no grasp of letters.
This is, _obviously_, false.

For example, I am a Pentolan, and I'm writing this field guide.

There is, however a grain of truth - the vast and multitudinous population of our city does not, largely, know how to read and write.
Nor do they need to!
Most of them have apprenticed to a Guild or learned the Craft from a family member or friend - and we teach all of our children the _Auratic Vision_ and _Message_ dweomers, of course.

Most Pentolans never learn to read not, as the Aydlinars would have you believe, because their lack of enlightenment leaves them unable to do so, but _simply because it isn't necessary_.

### Game Design Notes

It is useful for us to include notes on the intended design and function of the game - and to help you understand how and why you might alter these rules to suit your table.
They will always be rendered like this:

{{< aside mechanical "Design Concept" >}}
Explanation of concept and how it's intended to work, etc.
{{< /aside >}}
